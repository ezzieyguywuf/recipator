[!A CLI homebrew beer recipe creator](./recipator_screenshot.png)

This is a simple python recipe creator for homebrew beer. It was written  for
python 2.7. It uses argparse to parse command-line arguments and texttable to
output to the command-line in a legible manner. I've provided comments as I've
deemed necessary in order to explain what's going on, though I don't think I've
done such a great job describing what equations I've used.

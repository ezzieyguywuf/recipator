==========
- Finish implimenting saintaardvark's better error handling
    - Maybe use a custom exception, BadConfig for example, in order to
      reduce code replication? See example commented under the general
      section
    - This will probably result in "less clean" errors: is that a bad
      thing though?
- Output to some sort of form, with room for brew-day notes and tasting notes
- Specify units used
- Make command-line options better: right now they are not very intuitive
